				<doc>We want to be able to do experiments to find the 'tipping point' for the max emission beyond which the temperature does NOT revert to pre-industrial levels. For that we need the emissions at the time we start the experiment.  The correct way to do that is the use SAMPLE IF TRUE formula which reads off the input value under certain conditions (in our case at a certain time).  Our input is "All Human activity emissions GtCO2e/yr" which gets changed (later on) through our experiment.  Hence Vensim sees an simultaneous equation error.  The simplest way to break the simultaneity is to use "All Human activity emissions GtCO2e/yr" from the base run as a table / lookup input.</doc>

(2011) "The RCP GHG concentrations and their extension from 1765 to 2300", DOI 10.1007/s10584-011-0156-z, Climatic Change. The data was downloaded from While emission data for SOx (sulfur oxide), CO (carbon oxide), NMVOC (non-methane volatile organic compounds), NOx (nitrogen oxide), BC (black carbon), OC (organic carbon) and NH3 (hydrogen nitride) are given, it seemed to us that the more reliable source are the forcings from these compounds. That data is given as Total direct aerosol forcing (aggregating direct fossil fuel aerosol (organic carbon), direct fossil fuel aerosol (black carbon), direct sulphate aerosol, direct nitrate aerosol, direct biomass burning related aerosol and direct forcing from mineral dust aerosol. In addition, Meinshausen et al give the aerosol forcing from volcanic eruptions. Thus, we use aerosol data at the level of aggregation of radiative forcing, measured in W/m2</doc>

Since the atmospheric heat reservoir is very tiny, there needs to be an effect from that reservoir to limit melting if and when the reservoir is close to being depleted, for whatever reason. One reason could be the large scale experimental (in this model) release of methane hydrates.</doc>

It costs  around 2 G$ to build and run a CCS plant for its lifetime of 20 years. Thus, our available budget of 1 T$/yr will allow the continuing removal of ((1T$/yr)/(2G$/20yr))*1MtCO2/yr  = 10 GtCO2/yr.

				<doc>http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/modtran/ U Chicago David Archer, see his book for detail http://geosci.uchicago.edu/directory/david-archer Note that altitude should be set to 17km looking down, by default the model on the site looks down from 70km: "The main reason for that is in the influence of stratosphere. Radiative forcing is defined as a change in the flux just above troposphere after stratospheric temperatures have reached the new radiative energy balance, i.e., after the stratosphere has cooled. UChicago MODTRAN does not allow for cooling stratosphere. Results calculated at 17 km looking down are closer to the correct ones, but fully correct values require a model that makes the stratospheric corrections." We use tropical atm looking down from 70km because that is closest to Myhre 1998 New estimates of radiative forcing due to well mixed green house gases.</doc>

				<doc>In the base case the model moves carbon from biomass to the atmosphere. This is opposite of what the IPCC AR5 Fig 6-08 suggests, where "land" is a sink. The source of that figure is http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/14/data.htm Download the Excel sheet to get the detailed sources in addition to the data. The tab "Terrestrial Sink" gives the numbers for the "land". While it lists 9 models that provide data from 1959 onwards, it actually generates a residual (col B) that is close, but not identical, to the mean value of the models. I looked at one of the models (ISAM) in detail, PDF here: http://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/4/333/2013/esd-4-333-2013.html and found, as far as I understand, that only when PFT (plant functional type) fractions are kept constant (!) (experiment CTL) does the model produce a net flow of land carbon uptake from atmosphere to land which is reported in the Excel sheet. The other experiments are dropped. Thus, at the very least, more research is needed!</doc>

				<doc>This is part of the set of equations that lets the user experiment with finding the tipping point, ie above which temperature rise continues unabated.  We do this by entering the max CO2e emissions in 2050 in variable "Max CO2e emissions in 2050" (in GtCO2e/yr) and distributing that amount to the various greenhouse gases with an assumed shape that grows linearly from 2015 to the max in 2050 and then declines linearly from the max to zero in 2100. To be able to that we need to spread the assumed GtCO2e numbers over our emissions of CO2, CH4 and other GHG.  We do this by taking the CO2e numbers and multiply by the share of each gas from our base run.  Plus, we reconvert to real emissions with the repective GWPs (global warming potentials), units and molacular weights.
The final MAX function is there to make sure that emissions are never negative, which they can become from the final formulation if you run the model past 2100</doc>

				<doc>We assume that the permafrost area sits like a ring around the arctic ocean. The arctic ocean has a radius of about 2100 km, to get to the assumed area of permafrost (of 25 Mkm2), the outer ring needs a diamter of about 3500 km. Second, we assume that permafrost melting occurs from the outer radius linearly inwards. Simple calculations result that a retreat of of 1km towards the pole gives at the other ring an area of about 22 000 km2 and at the inner ring an area of about 13 000 km2. Averaging (which is a simplification that not be valid) the two gives about 17 500 km2.</doc>

The number chosen is guesswork, but note if you set it to 0, ALL circulation will stop, probably non-sensical. 0.33 means a slowdown by a third.</doc>

Those properties include the thermal conductivity, the thermal diffusivity and the heat capacity of the ground. The thermal conductivity is the ability of the soil to conduct heat, the heat capacity of a soil describes its ability to store heat and the thermal diffusivity is the quotient of those two parameters. An interesting new model, with source, is here: http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/permafrost/ from David Archer and his group the U of Chicago

				<doc>This odd variable is meant to capture the fact that heat not only diffuses from the warmer to the colder part of the ocean, but that heat transfer is critically dependent on circulation, down and upwelling.  We don't model that physical process in the required detail (partly because the physics is poorly understood), nor do we allow for the structure of circulation, down and upwelling to change so we need to introduce this effect in a general way, which we do through this 'gradient'.  One consequence is that the warmer part of the ocean will never be equal to the colder part, even if you run the model for tens of thousands of years, or even longer.</doc>
